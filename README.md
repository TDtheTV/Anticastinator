A desktop tool to know how much time you truly work... you lazy punk.

Back on 2013 Neil Cicierega released to the public a tool on his [Tumblr](https://neilblr.com/post/58757345346). Since the download link is broken and I found the concept pretty cool, I decided to recreate it my way with AutoHotkey. This is the first ever program I wrote using this language, so if you think some changes can be done, let me know!

PS: This only works on Windows!
